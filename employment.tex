		\textbf{Sr Computational Scientist}, Altos Labs\par
		I joined Altos Labs at launch. As one of the first bioinformaticians,
		I was a key contributor to its lead rejuvenation candidate program.
		I helped build out the genomics platforms for Altos Labs, and identified
		and initiated AI/ML research programs that are considered of top strategic
		importance.
\entry*[07/2020 - \textit{Present}]
	\textbf{Visiting Scholar, Northwestern University}\par
	In my free time, I research the effects of pheromone signaling on
	the lifespan, healthspan and sexual behaviors of \textit{C.~elegans} in the lab
	of Ilya Ruvinsky.
\entry*[03/2021 - 01/2022]
	\textbf{Senior Scientist I}, Rheos Medicines\par
	I developed precision biology methods using multimodal genomics measurements to
	identify responder and non-responder populations to candidate drugs.
	Rheos was unable to secure Series B funding in 2021 and closed its doors in 2022.
\entry*[11/2019 - 3/2021]
	\textbf{Computational Biologist II}, eGenesis\par
	I computationally designed a compendium of pig promoters that stably
	express genes ubiquitously or with high tissue-specificity at controlled
	levels in pig organs. I also developed methods to identify safe harbors
	resistant to epigenetic silencing. This work resulted in the transplantation
	of a pig kidney into a patient with end-stage renal disease who was able
	to leave the hospital without dialysis, and was featured in the 
	\href{https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/health/pig-kidney-organ-transplant.html}{\texttt{\textbf{New York Times}}}.
\entry*[01/2019--11/2019]
		\textbf{Postdoctoral Associate, MIT},\par
		\textbf{Lab of Eric J. Alm}\par	
		I developed computational methods to deconvolute individual transcriptomes
		from metatranscriptomes collected from communities with a known bacterial
		composition without the need for any molecular barcodes.
