abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is commonly used to identify genetic modules that respond to perturbations. In single cells, transcriptomes have been used as phenotypes, but this concept has not been applied to whole-organism RNA-seq. Also, quantifying and interpreting epistatic effects using expression profiles remains a challenge. We developed a single coefficient to quantify transcriptome-wide epistasis that reflects the underlying interactions and which can be interpreted intuitively. To demonstrate our approach, we sequenced four single and two double mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans From these mutants, we reconstructed the known hypoxia pathway. In addition, we uncovered a class of 56 genes with HIF-1-dependent expression that have opposite changes in expression in mutants of two genes that cooperate to negatively regulate HIF-1 abundance; however, the double mutant of these genes exhibits suppression epistasis. This class violates the classical model of HIF-1 regulation but can be explained by postulating a role of hydroxylated HIF-1 in transcriptional control.},

abstract = {Although transcriptomes have recently been used to perform epistasis analyses, they are not yet used to study intragenic function/structure relationships. We developed a theoretical framework to study allelic series using transcriptomic phenotypes. As a proof-of-concept, we apply our methods to an allelic series of dpy-22, a highly pleiotropic Caenorhabditis elegans gene orthologous to the human gene MED12, which encodes a subunit of the Mediator complex. Our methods identify functional regions within dpy-22 that modulate Mediator activity upon various genetic modules, including the Wnt and Ras modules.},

abstract = {Understanding genome and gene function in a whole organism requires us to fully comprehend the life cycle and the physiology of the organism in question. Caenorhabditis elegans XX animals are hermaphrodites that exhaust their sperm after 3 d of egg-laying. Even though C. elegans can live for many days after cessation of egg-laying, the molecular physiology of this state has not been as intensely studied as other parts of the life cycle, despite documented changes in behavior and metabolism. To study the effects of sperm depletion and aging of C. elegans during the first 6 d of adulthood, we measured the transcriptomes of first-day adult hermaphrodites and sixth-day sperm-depleted adults, and, at the same time points, mutant fog-2(lf) worms that have a feminized germline phenotype. We found that we could separate the effects of biological aging from sperm depletion. For a large subset of genes, young adult fog-2(lf) animals had the same gene expression changes as sperm-depleted sixth-day wild-type hermaphrodites, and these genes did not change expression when fog-2(lf) females reached the sixth day of adulthood. Taken together, this indicates that changing sperm status causes a change in the internal state of the worm, which we call the female-like state. Our data provide a high-quality picture of the changes that happen in global gene expression throughout the period of early aging in the worm.},

abstract = {Cutaneous angiosarcoma is an aggressive malignant mesenchymal vasoformative neoplasm that accounts for 1{\%} of all soft tissue sarcomas. Using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we analyzed the demographics and survival of cutaneous angiosarcoma. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program recorded 434 cases of cutaneous angiosarcoma from 1973 to 2007. The incidence was nearly the same in men (222 cases) and women (212 cases). Most patients were white (88{\%}) with a mean age of 73 years. African Americans made up only 4{\%} of the cases. Two hundred seventy (62{\%}) cases were tumors of the head and neck, whereas 106 (24{\%}) cases arose in the skin of the trunk. Grade was recorded in 194 cases (45{\%}): 28 were grade I, 44 were grade II, 60 were grade III, and 62 were grade IV. Survival rates of cutaneous angiosarcoma correlated with age, anatomical site, and stage of disease. Patients younger than 50 years had a 10-year relative survival rate of 71.7{\%}, whereas patients 50 years and older had a 36.8{\%} 10-year survival rate. Tumors of the scalp and neck resulted in a 13.8{\%} 10-year relative survival rate, whereas tumors arising in the trunk resulted in a 75.3{\%} 10-year survival rate. Tumors localized to the skin had better prognosis (53.6{\%} 10-year relative survival rate) than those with regional or distant stage (19.0{\%} and 6.2{\%}). Twenty-six percent of patients with angiosarcoma had a prior primary. Cutaneous angiosarcomas arise predominantly in the head and neck of white individuals older than 60 years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},
