	abstract = {Aging animals, particularly females, suffer from diminished reproductive ability, likely due to high costs of germline maintenance. Potential remedies may be found in signals exchanged by members of opposite sexes to promote reproductive success. We show that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, male pheromone facilitates healthy oocyte aging. This pheromone increases germline proliferation and physiological cell death, which is required to maintain oocyte quality. We show that young adults that have not yet commenced reproduction are particularly sensitive to signals from mates and nutrients, likely because during this narrow time window, they set an environment-appropriate balance between germline and soma investment. We advocate the study of social signals as a productive avenue for identifying regulators of physiology and aging. Pheromones exchanged by conspecifics are a major class of chemical signals that can alter behavior, physiology, and development. In particular, males and females communicate with potential mating partners via sex pheromones to promote reproductive success. Physiological and developmental mechanisms by which pheromones facilitate progeny production remain largely enigmatic. Here, we describe how a Caenorhabditis elegans male pheromone, ascr\#10, improves the oogenic germline. Before most signs of aging become evident, C. elegans hermaphrodites start producing lower-quality gametes characterized by abnormal morphology, increased rates of chromosomal nondisjunction, and higher penetrance of deleterious alleles. We show that exposure to the male pheromone substantially ameliorates these defects and reduces embryonic lethality. ascr\#10 stimulates proliferation of germline precursor cells in adult hermaphrodites. Coupled to the greater precursor supply is increased physiological germline cell death, which is required to improve oocyte quality in older mothers. The hermaphrodite germline is sensitive to the pheromone only during a time window, comparable in duration to a larval stage, in early adulthood. During this period, prereproductive adults assess the suitability of the environment for reproduction. Our results identify developmental events that occur in the oogenic germline in response to a male pheromone. They also suggest that the opposite effects of the pheromone on gamete quality and maternal longevity arise from competition over resource allocation between soma and the germline.}

	abstract = {Background Planarian flatworms are best known for their impressive regenerative capacity, yet this trait varies across species. In addition, planarians have other features that share morphology and function with the tissues of many other animals, including an outer mucociliary epithelium that drives planarian locomotion and is very similar to the epithelial linings of the human lung and oviduct. Planarians occupy a broad range of ecological habitats and are known to be sensitive to changes in their environment. Yet, despite their potential to provide valuable insight to many different fields, very few planarian species have been developed as laboratory models for mechanism-based research.Results Here we describe a previously undocumented planarian species, Girardia guanajuatiensis (G.gua). After collecting this species from a freshwater habitat in central Mexico, we characterized it at the morphological, cellular, and molecular level. We show that G.gua shares features with animals in the Girardia genus but also possesses traits that appear unique to this species.Conclusion Species comparisons are a powerful tool for dissecting both genotype to phenotype and ecology and evolution relationships. By thoroughly characterizing a new planarian species, our work facilitates future species comparisons as well as the molecular dissection of specific G.gua traits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.G.guaGirardia guanajuatiensisS.medSchmidtea mediterraneaDpadays post amputationDpidays post irradiation},

@article{Basta2020,
abstract = {When nutrients in their environment are exhausted, bacterial cells become arrested for growth. During these periods, a primary challenge is maintaining cellular integrity with a reduced capacity for renewal or repair. Here, we show that the heat-shock protease FtsH is generally required for growth arrest survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that this requirement is independent of a role in regulating lipopolysaccharide synthesis, as has been suggested for Escherichia coli. We find that ftsH interacts with diverse genes during growth and overlaps functionally with the other heatshock protease-encoding genes hslVU, lon, and clpXP to promote survival during growth arrest. Systematic deletion of the heatshock protease-encoding genes reveals that the proteases function hierarchically during growth arrest, with FtsH and ClpXP having primary, nonredundant roles, and HslVU and Lon deploying a secondary response to aging stress. This hierarchy is partially conserved during growth at high temperature and alkaline pH, suggesting that heat, pH, and growth arrest effectively impose a similar type of proteostatic stress at the cellular level. In support of this inference, heat and growth arrest act synergistically to kill cells, and protein aggregation appears to occur more rapidly in protease mutants during growth arrest and correlates with the onset of cell death. Our findings suggest that protein aggregation is a major driver of aging and cell death during growth arrest, and that coordinated activity of the heat-shock response is required to ensure ongoing protein quality control in the absence of growth.},

abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is commonly used to identify genetic modules that respond to perturbations. In single cells, transcriptomes have been used as phenotypes, but this concept has not been applied to whole-organism RNA-seq. Also, quantifying and interpreting epistatic effects using expression profiles remains a challenge. We developed a single coefficient to quantify transcriptome-wide epistasis that reflects the underlying interactions and which can be interpreted intuitively. To demonstrate our approach, we sequenced four single and two double mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans From these mutants, we reconstructed the known hypoxia pathway. In addition, we uncovered a class of 56 genes with HIF-1-dependent expression that have opposite changes in expression in mutants of two genes that cooperate to negatively regulate HIF-1 abundance; however, the double mutant of these genes exhibits suppression epistasis. This class violates the classical model of HIF-1 regulation but can be explained by postulating a role of hydroxylated HIF-1 in transcriptional control.},

Our methods identify functional regions within dpy-22 that modulate Mediator activity upon various genetic modules, including the Wnt and Ras modules.},

abstract = {Understanding genome and gene function in a whole organism requires us to fully comprehend the life cycle and the physiology of the organism in question. Caenorhabditis elegans XX animals are hermaphrodites that exhaust their sperm after 3 d of egg-laying. Even though C. elegans can live for many days after cessation of egg-laying, the molecular physiology of this state has not been as intensely studied as other parts of the life cycle, despite documented changes in behavior and metabolism. To study the effects of sperm depletion and aging of C. elegans during the first 6 d of adulthood, we measured the transcriptomes of first-day adult hermaphrodites and sixth-day sperm-depleted adults, and, at the same time points, mutant fog-2(lf) worms that have a feminized germline phenotype. We found that we could separate the effects of biological aging from sperm depletion. For a large subset of genes, young adult fog-2(lf) animals had the same gene expression changes as sperm-depleted sixth-day wild-type hermaphrodites, and these genes did not change expression when fog-2(lf) females reached the sixth day of adulthood. Taken together, this indicates that changing sperm status causes a change in the internal state of the worm, which we call the female-like state. Our data provide a high-quality picture of the changes that happen in global gene expression throughout the period of early aging in the worm.},

abstract = {Cutaneous angiosarcoma is an aggressive malignant mesenchymal vasoformative neoplasm that accounts for 1{\%} of all soft tissue sarcomas. Using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we analyzed the demographics and survival of cutaneous angiosarcoma. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program recorded 434 cases of cutaneous angiosarcoma from 1973 to 2007. The incidence was nearly the same in men (222 cases) and women (212 cases). Most patients were white (88{\%}) with a mean age of 73 years. African Americans made up only 4{\%} of the cases. Two hundred seventy (62{\%}) cases were tumors of the head and neck, whereas 106 (24{\%}) cases arose in the skin of the trunk. Grade was recorded in 194 cases (45{\%}): 28 were grade I, 44 were grade II, 60 were grade III, and 62 were grade IV. Survival rates of cutaneous angiosarcoma correlated with age, anatomical site, and stage of disease. Patients younger than 50 years had a 10-year relative survival rate of 71.7{\%}, whereas patients 50 years and older had a 36.8{\%} 10-year survival rate. Tumors of the scalp and neck resulted in a 13.8{\%} 10-year relative survival rate, whereas tumors arising in the trunk resulted in a 75.3{\%} 10-year survival rate. Tumors localized to the skin had better prognosis (53.6{\%} 10-year relative survival rate) than those with regional or distant stage (19.0{\%} and 6.2{\%}). Twenty-six percent of patients with angiosarcoma had a prior primary. Cutaneous angiosarcomas arise predominantly in the head and neck of white individuals older than 60 years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},
